# r5reloaded-updaters
Three shell scripts updaters/installers for R5Reloaded.

  [1.](https://github.com/begin-theadventure/r5reloaded-updaters/releases/download/r5reloaded-updaters/r5reloaded-update-all.sh) All = depot and scripts.
  
  [2.](https://github.com/begin-theadventure/r5reloaded-updaters/releases/download/r5reloaded-updaters/r5reloaded-update-depot.sh) Only depot.
  
  [3.](https://github.com/begin-theadventure/r5reloaded-updaters/releases/download/r5reloaded-updaters/r5reloaded-update-scripts.sh) Only scripts.

It works in the current directory so put it in your R5Reloaded directory. Before using you need to allow executing.
