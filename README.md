# r5reloaded-upllers
Three shell script **up**daters/insta**llers** for R5Reloaded.

1. r5r-upller-depot.sh - only depot (release scripts included). This script is recommended.

2. r5r-upller-scripts.sh - only git scripts.

3. r5r-upller-all.sh - depot and git scripts.

They work in the current directory so put them in the game folder. Before using, allow executing.
