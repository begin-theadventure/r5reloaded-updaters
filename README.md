Three shell scripts for R5Reloaded that update/install.

  [1.](https://github.com/begin-theadventure/r5reloaded-updaters/releases/download/r5reloaded-updaters/r5reloaded-update-all.sh) All = depot and scripts.
  
  [2.](https://github.com/begin-theadventure/r5reloaded-updaters/releases/download/r5reloaded-updaters/r5reloaded-update-depot.sh) Only depot.
  
  [3.](https://github.com/begin-theadventure/r5reloaded-updaters/releases/download/r5reloaded-updaters/r5reloaded-update-scripts.sh) Only scripts.

It works in the current directory so put it in the game folder. Before using, allow executing.
